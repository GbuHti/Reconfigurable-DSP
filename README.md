# Reconfigurable-DSP
aim to find a effective Interconnection between computing units of DSP, if possible, make this interconnection reconfigurable.

- [x] Complex programs require more flexible address access, need to expand configuration information format
- [ ] Mount Data Memory on the BUS.
- [ ] RFU should be refined to RTL at first and integrate it with ARM Cortex A9 processor on the ZYNQ platform.
- [ ] Is there any possible to achieve RTL and TLM codesign????
